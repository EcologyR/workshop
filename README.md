A template for course websites developed with Quarto and hosted on GitHub

Only need to edit the source files in Quarto. The website is generated and hosted automatically by GitHub.

See also https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2022/teach-ds-course-website for a more developed example

Note: If using this repo as a template for a new repo of yours, remember to check 'Include all branches' when creating the repository (because we will need the gh-pages branch to host the website).

Remember to also update the links to your GitHub repo in [_quarto.yml](https://github.com/Pakillo/quarto-course-website-template/blob/main/_quarto.yml)
